 the bouncing ball project has successfully demonstrated the utilization of the
OpenGL library to create an interactive 3D animation of a bouncing ball. The project has served
multiple purposes, including providing a platform for learning and understanding the basics of
OpenGL programming, showcasing the capabilities of OpenGL in rendering and manipulating
3D objects, and offering a foundation for further development of more complex 3D graphics
applications.
